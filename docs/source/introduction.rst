============

**dab stands for Django-Ajax-Bootstrap**
PS: Ajax and JQuery are not used anymore since v2.0.0 Vanilla JS and fetch API is used instead.

``django-comments-dab`` is a commenting application for Django-powered websites.

It allows you to integrate commenting functionality with any model you have e.g. blogs, pictures, video etcâ€¦

*List of actions that can be performed:*

    1. Post a new comment. (v2.0.0 authenticated and anonymous users)

    2. Reply to an existing comment. (v2.0.0 authenticated and anonymous users)

    3. Edit a comment. (authenticated user `comment owner`)

    4. Delete a comment. (authenticated user `comment owner` and admins)

    5. React to a comment. (authenticated users) Available reactions are LIKE and DISLIKE  # open PR if you would like to have more reactions

    6. Report (flag) a comment. (authenticated users)
